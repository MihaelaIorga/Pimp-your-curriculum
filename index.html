                <h3><img class="check" src="images/check.png" alt="logo"> Practice oriented learning</h3>
                     <p class="teach-p">The teaching is interdisciplinary and practice-oriented. It primarily takes place in an open environment rather than the traditional classroom setting. The learning environment is designed to be flexible, so as to allow teachers and students to meet in both formal and informal settings to resolve interdisciplinary problems in connection with projects and tasks undertaken for public and private organisations.

                <h3><img class="check" src="images/check.png" alt="logo"> Academic Progression</h3>
                     <p class="teach-p">
The programme is structured around four core areas, which are further divided into a number of sub-topics each with their own learning objectives. The core areas, courses and learning objectives are divided between three compulsory semesters to ensure the same academic/professional progression and level of complexity for all students. The specialisation takes place in connection with the elective subjects in the third semester. The internship in the fourth semester ensures that students acquire practical knowledge about the profession and learn how to tackle practical issues. The final project in the fourth semester adds new perspectives to the student’s specialisation and internship through the application of academic theory and method to a practical issue or problem.

                    <h3><img class="check" src="images/check.png" alt="logo"> Project Work</h3>
                     <p class="teach-p">KEA places great emphasis on project work, on contact with the business community and on use of the latest technologies. The project-based working method provides students with important teamwork experience, and as part of the problem-oriented study environment, students acquire experience with the formulation of problem statements and problem solving. Process and method are essential parts of the learning environment at all times and also form part of the basis for assessment in connection with tests and exams.

                    <h3><img class="check" src="images/check.png" alt="logo"> Motivation</h3>
                     <p class="teach-p">An important prerequisite for completing the programme is active participation in classes, project work and supervision interviews. Students are expected to share in the responsibility for their own learning, which requires motivation and commitment, independence, self-initiative and critical thinking. This is a condition for active participation in the organisation of the students’ own work – not least in connection with projects.
